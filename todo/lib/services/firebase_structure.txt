# Firestore Database Structure

## Collections:

### users
- Document ID: firstuzer_001 OR firstpm_001 (depending on if the user is a developer or project manager, this document id is generated by the displayName being lowercased and put to one string [First Uzer -> firstuzer] + '_' + id that must be appended each time by 1 from the previous role's number, so the next would be 002, 003 if 2 new developers were added, and if one project manager was added, then 002 for pm's. For project managers, theirs is generated the same, but 'pm' is appended at the end of their display name.

    - updatedAt: timestamp
    - status: string ('active', 'completed', 'on_hold')
    - members: array of user_ids

  - Subcollection: tasks
    - Document ID: ed_001 (generated by taking the first 2 chars of the project [Eduvos -> ed] and lowercasing them and then adding an underscore with id [_001] for each task, meaning if I have 2 clients/projects, Eduvos and Google, and I add 2 more tasks to Eduvos and 1 to Google, then I would have ed_001, ed_002, ed_003, go_001)
